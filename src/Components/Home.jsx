            TEDxSMIT first gained prominence through the success of its inaugural event: TEDxSMIT - Freedom Meets Courage. This
            marked the pioneering TEDx conference in Sikkim, orchestrated entirely by a dedicated team of students from the
            esteemed Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology (SMIT), in collaboration with the SMIT Alumni Association. Over the
            years, TEDxSMIT has continued to flourish, hosting a total of four conferences in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019.
